Hello! this repo serves as a portfoilo for my iOS development journey!

## PowerRoute

This is a application that me and my friend [@ChanunyaO](https://github.com/ChanunyaO) developed as a senior project!
PowerRoute is a mobile application dedicated to reduce the number of researching step for EV Driver when they have to drive for a long trip.
This application provide the ability to choose Start and Destination and the route and charging plan will be generated for user!
User can input their cars up to 5 cars and can switching between their car as a default car. In the car detail, application will asked the driving time preference which is a time that indicate how long user want to be on EV for one-leg. If user doesn't concerned about the time, the 'auto' option is provide and the route and charging plan will generate focus on the battery percentage and suggested the route with the fastest way possible. (for 1-4 driving time perference options, the calculation is based on time, and battery remaining as well.)

This application is my first project that help me learn from the ground up, I have gained the knowledge of how to setting up the project, how to collaraborate with team, data managment, third party integration, and a lot more during the development.

We used Swift, SwiftUI, Firebase, Maps API, and EV charger in Thailand that I have collect from open source and launch the API to serves in this project.
